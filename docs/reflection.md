## GitHub vs. Wordpress

  I did this assignment with GitHub and Wordpress. I think that after completing sites with both of them, Wordpress was much easier to use. GitHub was not awful to use, but it still took some getting used to. The Markdown language was kind of hard to learn at first because I did not know what I was doing, but the more I learned the style of the code the better I got with it.

  The most significant challenge I had with GitHub was finding out how to write that type of code. I am used to HTML and CSS because I took a course last year that showed me how to use them. GitHub is a whole new language of coding so, I had to learn that before I could write on my site. A challenge I had with Wordpress involved themes and links. I could not find themes I thought were good with navigation and text at first. Then, when I went to add links, I could not figure out why just adding the links was not working. I soon found out that there is a button you have to press before you add links that I did not notice before so, that was an easy fix. In Wordpress, modifying the layout and organization is not too bad for me. It lets you pick a theme and that kind of organizes everything for you. I imagine that if you wanted to make further modifications you could mess around with the HTML code in the “Text” tab. In GitHub, I had quite the time trying to figure out how to move things around. If I had to give any advice it would be to use others experience to your benefit. Look up how to fix issues you do not know about. Chances are someone has gone through the same situation. 
	
  Wordpress has many advantages over GitHub. When working with Wordpress, you do not really need to code. You type in the first tab that says “Visual” and the code on the other tab writes itself. It is very useful, especially if you are on a time crunch. GitHub uses Markdown code, and you have to use coding the whole time if you want anything to come out the way you envision it. However, an advantage to GitHub is that even though it’s all code, it’s easier than HTML or CSS. Occasionally, you can still use HTML in GitHub is need be so, that is also very helpful.
A skill I think would be useful in both sites is just learning the code. Studying the Markdown language would be most helpful because then, I would not have to look up things I did not know every few minutes. Studying HTML deeper would be nice too. I know some of it, but only the basics. A skill I want to improve on with Wordpress would just be learning more about HTML than I already know. I want to improve on my Markdown code as well.
